## Introduction

**DMVMockTest** is a web application designed to help users prepare for their driving permit tests through interactive, mock test questions based on the DMV manual. The initial focus is on Washington State (WA), with plans to expand to other states in the future. The application will feature a clean and engaging UI with integrated ad monetization and optional user accounts for tracking progress.

## Goals and Objectives

- **User Practice:** Deliver an intuitive platform for users to practice DMV test questions with immediate feedback.
- **Content Focus:** Initially provide content from WAâ€™s DMV manual; expand to include multiple states later.
- **Monetization:** Generate revenue through integrated ads without compromising the user experience.
- **Scalability:** Build a modular, scalable codebase that supports additional features (user accounts, history tracking, multi-state support).

## System Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  - A single-page application (SPA) built with React for a dynamic user experience.
- **Backend :**  
  - PostgreSQL for user authentication and database storage (quiz history, question bank, bugs report).
- **Hosting and Deployment:**  
  - Vercel for dynamic site hosting.
  - SupaBase for database hosting
  - GitHub for version control and CI/CD.
- **Ad Integration:**
  - Google AdSense

## UI/UX Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Clean Layout:** Emphasize simplicity and clarity to help users focus on the test content.
- **User Feedback:** Immediate feedback on answers with intuitive navigation.
- **Ad Placement:** Strategically place ads (e.g., header or sidebar) to maintain a balance between monetization and user experience.

## Future Updates

- **Security:**  
  - Utilize Cloudflare for DDoS protection.
- **Features**
  - User login to keep track of question history
  - Navigate to the manual to learn instead of only answering questions
  - Traffic Icons related questions

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Early Stage - Done:**  
   - Create the GitHub repository and initialize the React project.
   - Implement the basic test flow as a static page (single question, answer feedback).
   - Deploy to the web.
   - *Estimated Completion:* 2-3 weeks.
   - *Completed in:* 4 days.

2. **Middle Stage - Done:**
   - Set up the database.
   - Transition to a dynamic page to interact with the database.
   - Refine UI design and basic ad integration.
   - Add bug report to get feedback from users into database
   - *Estimated Completion:* Additional 1-2 weeks.
   - *Completed in:* 8 days.

4. **Final Stage**
   - Get permission from Google Adsense and start generating revenue.
   - Add user authentication and history tracking.
   - Expand the question bank to support multiple states.
   - *Estimated Completion:* 4-6 weeks.

6. **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
   - Continuous testing, UI improvements, and feature updates based on user feedback.
